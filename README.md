# 3D-Ultrasound-Defect-Analysis
This project demonstrates a workflow for analyzing and visualizing defects in 3D ultrasound data.

## Overview
- Load ultrasound volumes and segmentation masks
- Extract defect metrics: centroid, area, and slice index
- Visualize defect progression:
  - 2D slices for inspection
  - 3D spheres representing defect location and size
- Color and size encode slice progression and defect magnitude

## Tools
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, PyVista, SimpleITK, Jupyter Notebook

## Purpose
Provides a clear, interpretable view of defect morphology and progression for inspection and analysis.
